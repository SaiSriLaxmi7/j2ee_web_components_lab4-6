RestaurantDineIn - Setup & Run
I have developed a web application using Java Servlets, and MySQL,Hibernate . To set up the project, I have configured a MySQL database named RestaurantDineIn and updated DBConnection.java with the correct database credentials. I have deployed the project in Apache Tomcat (version 10+). After starting Tomcat. I have implemented displaymenu, database. If any issues occur, I have checked Tomcat logs and verified the database connection to troubleshoot.and i restarted the tomcat and the eclipse.
